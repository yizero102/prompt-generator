  "metaprompt_thinking": "The user wants me to write instructions for an AI assistant to rate a resume according to a rubric. Let me think about what this task involves:\n\n1. The AI needs to receive a resume and a rubric\n2. It needs to evaluate the resume against the rubric criteria\n3. It needs to provide a rating/score with justification\n\nI need to structure this properly:\n- First, I need to define what inputs are needed (the resume content and the rubric)\n- Then I need to structure the instructions to tell the AI how to evaluate the resume\n- The AI should provide both a score and justification\n\nLooking at the examples, I see that complex tasks might benefit from having the AI think through things step by step. Since evaluating a resume involves multiple criteria and subjective judgment, this seems like a task that would benefit from a structured approach with reasoning.\n\nLet me plan the structure:\n1. Define inputs: resume content and rubric\n2. Tell the AI to first understand the rubric criteria\n3. Have the AI analyze each section of the resume against each rubric criterion\n4. Ask for justification first, then the final score\n5. Specify output format\n\nThis seems like a moderately complex task that would benefit from structured thinking, so I should include some guidance on how to approach the evaluation systematically.",
