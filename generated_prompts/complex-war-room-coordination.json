Triaging customer-impacting incidents\n2. Assigning cross-functional owners \n3. Producing executive-ready situation reports\n4. Operating under rapidly changing constraints\n\nLet me break down what variables would be needed:\n- Incident feed: Real-time or batch updates about incidents occurring\n- Response directory: Information about personnel, teams, roles, and their capabilities/responsibilities\n- Executive constraints: Time pressures, budget constraints, regulatory requirements, etc.\n\nThe instruction structure should:\n1. First define the input variables\n2. Then provide step-by-step instructions on how to coordinate the war room\n3. Include format for situation reports\n4. Provide guidance on prioritization and assignment logic\n\nThis is a complex task so I should include a scratchpad/inner monologue section for the AI to think through the prioritization and assignments systematically.",
