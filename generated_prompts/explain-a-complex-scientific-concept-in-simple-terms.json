I need to analyze the examples provided to understand the pattern and structure required.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n1. The first example has inputs like {$FAQ} and {$QUESTION}\n2. The structure includes:\n   - Clear task definition\n   - Rules and constraints \n   - Specific formatting requirements with XML tags\n   - The actual inputs are referenced using the variable names without brackets\n\nFor this task, I need to identify the minimal set of inputs needed:\n- The complex scientific concept that needs to be explained\n- The audience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) to tailor the explanation\n\nThe instruction should:\n- Tell the AI what task to perform (explain complex scientific concepts simply)\n- Specify the inputs it will receive\n- Provide guidelines on how to approach this task\n- Include formatting requirements\n- Maybe include an example\n\nLet me structure this properly.",

Your goal is to make difficult scientific ideas understandable to people regardless of their scientific background.\n\nHere are the inputs you will receive:\n- A complex scientific concept: {$CONCEPT}\n- The target audience level: {$AUDIENCE_LEVEL} (choose from: \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", \"advanced\")\n\nYour task is to explain the concept using the following guidelines:\n\n**Language and Tone:**\n- Use clear, conversational language appropriate for the specified audience level\n- Beginner: Use everyday analogies and avoid technical jargon entirely\n- Intermediate: Use some technical terms but explain them clearly\n- Advanced: Use proper scientific terminology but still ensure clarity\n- Write as if you're speaking directly to a curious friend\n\n**Explanation Structure:**\n1. Start with a simple, relatable analogy or everyday example\n2. Explain the core idea in 1-2 sentences\n3. Break down the concept into 2-4 key points\n4. Address common misconceptions if relevant\n5. End with why this concept matters or how it's applied in real life\n\n**Key Techniques:**\n- Use analogies that most people can relate to (e.g., comparing atoms to solar systems, electricity to water flow)\n- Avoid unnecessary technical details\n- Use active voice and present tense when possible\n- Include visual descriptions when helpful\n- Break complex processes into sequential steps\n- Use concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions\n\n**Formatting Requirements:**\n- Start your explanation with \"Here's how I'd explain [concept]:\" \n- Use simple bullet points or numbered lists for key points\n- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)\n- Use analogies in quotation marks to set them apart\n- End with a brief real-world application or significance\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Don't assume prior knowledge beyond basic common sense\n- Don't use more than 3-4 technical terms total (even for advanced level)\n- Don't include mathematical equations or formulas\n- Don't go into excessive detail about historical discovery\n- Don't use vague metaphors (be specific in your analogies)\n\n**Length Guidelines:**\n- Beginner: 150-250 words\n- Intermediate: 200-350 words  \n- Advanced: 250-400 words\n\nBefore writing your explanation, use a <scratchpad> to:\n1.
