  "metaprompt_thinking": "Alright, let me analyze this task. The user is asking me to write instructions for an AI assistant to complete a task - specifically to \"Explain a complex scientific concept in simple terms\". \n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to:\n\n1. Define the input variables the assistant will need\n2. Structure the instructions clearly\n3. Create a comprehensive instruction set similar to the examples\n\nFor this task, what inputs would the assistant need?\n- The complex scientific concept to be explained (required)\n- Possibly the target audience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) to tailor the explanation appropriately\n- Maybe the preferred explanation format (analogy, step-by-step, visual description, etc.)\n\nThe task is relatively straightforward - explain complex concepts simply. I should structure the instructions to:\n- Guide the assistant to identify the key components of the concept\n- Encourage the use of analogies and simple language\n- Remind them to avoid jargon or explain it when necessary\n- Suggest organizing the explanation from simple to complex\n- Ask for examples or analogies to illustrate points\n\nLooking at the examples:\n1. The customer service example has specific rules and FAQ-based responses\n2. The sentence comparison example has a clear yes/no format\n3. The document Q&A example has a specific quote and answer format with references\n4. The math tutor example is more interactive with inner monologues\n5. The function calling example has specific technical constraints\n\nFor this explanation task, I think the closest model is the document Q&A example since it involves processing information and presenting it in a structured way. However, this task is more creative/explanatory rather than fact-based.\n\nI should create instructions that are clear, comprehensive, and guide the assistant to produce high-quality simplified explanations while maintaining scientific accuracy.",
