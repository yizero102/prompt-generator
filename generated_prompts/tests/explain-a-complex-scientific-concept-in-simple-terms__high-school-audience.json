  "prompt_with_variables": "\nYou are an expert science communicator tasked with explaining complex scientific concepts in simple, accessible terms. Your goal is to make difficult scientific ideas understandable to people regardless of their scientific background.\n\nHere are the inputs you will receive:\n- A complex scientific concept: Quantum entanglement: a quantum phenomenon where pairs of particles remain connected so that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.\n- The target audience level: Curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics. (choose from: \"beginner\", \"intermediate\", \"advanced\")\n\nYour task is to explain the concept using the following guidelines:\n\n**Language and Tone:**\n- Use clear, conversational language appropriate for the specified audience level\n- Beginner: Use everyday analogies and avoid technical jargon entirely\n- Intermediate: Use some technical terms but explain them clearly\n- Advanced: Use proper scientific terminology but still ensure clarity\n- Write as if you're speaking directly to a curious friend\n\n**Explanation Structure:**\n1. Start with a simple, relatable analogy or everyday example\n2. Explain the core idea in 1-2 sentences\n3. Break down the concept into 2-4 key points\n4. Address common misconceptions if relevant\n5. End with why this concept matters or how it's applied in real life\n\n**Key Techniques:**\n- Use analogies that most people can relate to (e.g., comparing atoms to solar systems, electricity to water flow)\n- Avoid unnecessary technical details\n- Use active voice and present tense when possible\n- Include visual descriptions when helpful\n- Break complex processes into sequential steps\n- Use concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions\n\n**Formatting Requirements:**\n- Start your explanation with \"Here's how I'd explain [concept]:\" \n- Use simple bullet points or numbered lists for key points\n- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)\n- Use analogies in quotation marks to set them apart\n- End with a brief real-world application or significance\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n- Don't assume prior knowledge beyond basic common sense\n- Don't use more than 3-4 technical terms total (even for advanced level)\n- Don't include mathematical equations or formulas\n- Don't go into excessive detail about historical discovery\n- Don't use vague metaphors (be specific in your analogies)\n\n**Length Guidelines:**\n- Beginner: 150-250 words\n- Intermediate: 200-350 words  \n- Advanced: 250-400 words\n\nBefore writing your explanation, use a <scratchpad> to:\n1. Identify the 2-3 most fundamental aspects of the concept\n2. Think of 2-3 potential analogies and choose the best one\n3. Consider what the audience at this level might find confusing\n\nNow, explain the concept Quantum entanglement: a quantum phenomenon where pairs of particles remain connected so that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance. for a Curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics. audience. Write your explanation inside <answer> tags.",
  "thinking": "Let me analyze this request step by step.\n\n**Task Analysis:**\n- Concept: Quantum entanglement\n- Audience: Curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics\n- This falls under \"intermediate\" level since they have some physics background\n- Need to use <scratchpad> first, then write explanation inside <answer> tags\n\n**Scratchpad Section:**\n\n1. **Most fundamental aspects of quantum entanglement:**\n   - Particles can be \"linked\" or correlated\n   - When you measure one particle, it instantly affects the other\n   - This happens regardless of distance (instantaneous)\n\n2. **Potential analogies:**\n   - Magic coins that always show opposite sides when flipped\n   - Twin siblings who always finish each other's sentences\n   - A pair of special dice that always show opposite numbers\n   - Synchronized swimmers who move in perfect harmony\n\nBest analogy: Magic dice or magic coins - concrete, familiar objects that teenagers can visualize.\n\n3. **What might be confusing:**\n   - The \"instantaneous\" part (seems to violate speed of light)\n   - How particles become \"entangled\" in the first place\n   - Why measuring one affects the other (is information traveling?)\n   - The difference between correlation and causation\n\n**Structure Plan:**\n1. Start with magic dice analogy\n2. Core explanation: particles can be connected so measuring one instantly affects the other\n3. Key points: how they're created, what happens when measured, the distance aspect\n4. Address misconception about faster-than-light communication\n5. Real-world application: quantum computing and secure communications\n\n**Length:** For intermediate level, target 250-300 words.\n\nNow I'll write the explanation following the guidelines.",
  "output": "<scratchpad>\n1. **Most fundamental aspects of quantum entanglement:**\n   - Particles can be mysteriously \"linked\" or correlated in a way that measuring one instantly affects the other\n   - This connection works regardless of how far apart the particles are\n   - The particles are created together in a specific way that establishes this connection\n\n2. **Potential analogies and best choice:**\n   - Magic dice that always show opposite numbers when rolled\n   - Twin siblings who always react the same way to the same question\n   - Synchronized swimmers moving in perfect harmony\n   - **Best choice:** Magic dice or magic coins - familiar objects that teenagers can easily visualize and understand the \"instant correlation\" concept\n\n3. **What might confuse this audience:**\n   - The \"instantaneous\" aspect might seem to violate Einstein's speed limit (but it doesn't transmit information)\n   - How particles actually become entangled in practice\n   - The difference between correlation and actual \"communication\" between particles\n   - Why this is different from just having two regular objects that happen to be similar\n</scratchpad>\n\n<answer>\nHere's how I'd explain quantum entanglement:\n\nImagine you have a pair of \"magic dice\" that always show opposite numbers - if one shows a 6, the other instantly shows a 1. No matter how far apart you take these dice, this connection remains. You could put one die on Earth and the other on Mars, and the magic would still work.\n\n**Core concept:** Quantum entanglement is when two particles become mysteriously connected so that measuring one instantly determines the state of the other, even across vast distances.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Creating the connection:** When two particles interact under special conditions (like in certain chemical reactions or when split from a single particle), they become \"entangled\" - essentially linked in a quantum way\n\n2. **The measurement effect:** When you measure something about one particle (like its spin or polarization), the other particle instantly \"collapses\" into the opposite state, no matter how far away it is\n\n3. **The distance mystery:** This seems to happen faster than light could travel between them, but it's not actually \"communication\" - it's more like the particles are part of the same quantum system\n\n**Common misconception:** This doesn't let us send messages faster than light. The outcome of each measurement is still random - we just know the results will be correlated.\n\n**Why it matters:** Quantum entanglement is the foundation of quantum computing and quantum cryptography, which could create ultra-secure communication networks and solve complex problems much faster than regular computers.\n</answer>"
