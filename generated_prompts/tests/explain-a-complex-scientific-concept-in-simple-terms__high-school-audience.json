  "prompt_with_variables": "\nYou are an expert science communicator tasked with explaining complex scientific concepts in simple, accessible terms. Your goal is to make difficult scientific ideas understandable to people without a technical background while maintaining accuracy.\n\nHere is the complex scientific concept you need to explain:\n<concept>Quantum entanglement: a quantum phenomenon where pairs of particles remain connected so that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.</concept>\n\nHere is the target audience level for your explanation:\n<audience_level>Curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics.</audience_level>\n\nPlease follow these guidelines to create your explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Core Components**: Break down the concept into its 3-5 most essential elements. Focus on the fundamental principles rather than peripheral details.\n\n2. **Use Analogies and Metaphors**: Connect the scientific concept to everyday experiences or familiar objects. For example:\n   - Electrical circuits → water flowing through pipes\n   - DNA → a recipe book\n   - Atoms → solar systems\n\n3. **Layer Information**: Build understanding from simple to complex:\n   - Start with basic definitions\n   - Add context and significance\n   - Include real-world applications\n   - Conclude with why it matters\n\n4. **Language Guidelines**:\n   - Replace technical jargon with common terms\n   - If scientific terms are unavoidable, define them immediately\n   - Use active voice and present tense when possible\n   - Keep sentences short (under 20 words)\n\n5. **Structure Your Explanation**:\n   - Begin with a simple analogy or everyday example\n   - Explain the basic mechanism or process\n   - Provide one concrete example or application\n   - Summarize the key takeaway\n\n6. **Accuracy Check**: After writing, verify that:\n   - Your explanation doesn't contradict scientific consensus\n   - Important nuances aren't oversimplified to the point of error\n   - The complexity level matches the target audience\n\n7. **Tailor to Audience Level**:\n   - **Beginner**: Use basic analogies, avoid numbers/measurements\n   - **Intermediate**: Can include some technical terms with explanations\n   - **Advanced**: Can reference related concepts and applications\n\n**Output Format**:\nProvide your explanation in <simple_explanation> tags, with these sections:\n1. **Simple Analogy**: One sentence connecting to everyday experience\n2. **Basic Explanation**: 2-3 paragraphs explaining the concept\n3. **Real-World Example**: One concrete application or instance\n4. **Why It Matters**: Brief statement of significance\n\nDo not include technical jargon without explanation. If the concept cannot be accurately simplified to the target audience level, clearly state this limitation.\n\nExample structure:\n<simple_explanation>\n<analogy>DNA is like a recipe book that contains all the instructions for building and running a human body.</analogy>\n<explanation>[Basic explanation paragraphs]</explanation>\n<example>[Real-world application]</example>\n<significance>[Why this matters]</significance>\n</simple_explanation>\n\nBegin your explanation now.",
  "thinking": "Let me think about how to explain quantum entanglement to curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics.\n\nI need to identify the core components:\n1. Quantum particles can become \"linked\" or correlated\n2. This connection remains even when particles are separated by large distances\n3. Measuring one particle instantly affects the other\n4. This happens faster than light could travel between them\n5. The particles are described by quantum superpositions\n\nFor analogies, I should think of:\n- Two dice that always show opposite numbers when rolled\n- Two magic coins that always show different sides\n- Twins with telepathic connection\n- Two synchronized dancers\n- Two quantum versions of classic objects\n\nLet me use the dice analogy - it's visual and easy to understand.\n\nLanguage should be:\n- Active voice\n- Short sentences\n- Avoid jargon or explain it immediately\n- Build from simple to complex\n\nStructure:\n1. Simple analogy\n2. Basic explanation (2-3 paragraphs)\n3. Real-world example\n4. Why it matters\n\nFor real-world examples, I should mention quantum computing, quantum cryptography, or maybe quantum sensors. Quantum cryptography might be most relatable since it relates to security, which students understand.\n\nLet me check accuracy:\n- Don't oversimplify to say information travels faster than light\n- Don't suggest we can use entanglement for instant communication\n- Do explain that the correlation is established at the moment of entanglement\n- Do mention that measuring one particle \"collapses\" the superposition\n- Do emphasize this is about correlations, not classical information transfer",
  "output": "<simple_explanation>\n<analogy>Imagine two magic dice that always show opposite numbers - if one lands on 6, the other instantly shows 1, no matter how far apart they are.</analogy>\n\n<explanation>Quantum entanglement is like having two particles that become deeply connected at the subatomic level. Think of it like creating a special bond between two particles when they're close together. Once this bond exists, the particles behave like they're still connected, even if we separate them by thousands of miles.\n\nHere's what makes this strange: before we look at either particle, each exists in multiple possible states at once - like a coin spinning in the air that's neither heads nor tails until it lands. The moment we measure one particle and see one outcome, the other particle instantly \"knows\" what its state should be to match their correlation. This happens faster than light could travel between them.\n\nThis connection isn't something we can use to send messages instantly. Instead, it's more like having two perfectly synchronized watches. Once they're synchronized, they always show the same time, even when separated. The magic isn't in communication - it's in the perfect correlation that exists from the moment they became connected.</explanation>\n\n<example>Scientists are using entangled particles to create ultra-secure communication systems. When information gets encrypted using entangled particles, any attempt to intercept or read the message would instantly disrupt the entanglement, alerting both sender and receiver to the security breach. This could one day protect our most sensitive digital communications from hacking.</example>\n\n<significance>Quantum entanglement challenges our everyday understanding of how the universe works and is opening new possibilities for unbreakable codes, ultra-sensitive sensors, and powerful computers that could solve problems too complex for today's technology.</significance>\n</simple_explanation>"
