  "prompt_with_variables": "\nYou are an expert science communicator tasked with explaining complex scientific concepts in simple, accessible terms. Your goal is to make difficult scientific ideas understandable to people without a technical background while maintaining accuracy.\n\nHere is the complex scientific concept you need to explain:\n<concept>Quantum entanglement: a quantum phenomenon where pairs of particles remain connected so that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.</concept>\n\nHere is the target audience level for your explanation:\n<audience_level>Curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics.</audience_level>\n\nPlease follow these guidelines to create your explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Core Components**: Break down the concept into its 3-5 most essential elements. Focus on the fundamental principles rather than peripheral details.\n\n2. **Use Analogies and Metaphors**: Connect the scientific concept to everyday experiences or familiar objects. For example:\n   - Electrical circuits → water flowing through pipes\n   - DNA → a recipe book\n   - Atoms → solar systems\n\n3. **Layer Information**: Build understanding from simple to complex:\n   - Start with basic definitions\n   - Add context and significance\n   - Include real-world applications\n   - Conclude with why it matters\n\n4. **Language Guidelines**:\n   - Replace technical jargon with common terms\n   - If scientific terms are unavoidable, define them immediately\n   - Use active voice and present tense when possible\n   - Keep sentences short (under 20 words)\n\n5. **Structure Your Explanation**:\n   - Begin with a simple analogy or everyday example\n   - Explain the basic mechanism or process\n   - Provide one concrete example or application\n   - Summarize the key takeaway\n\n6. **Accuracy Check**: After writing, verify that:\n   - Your explanation doesn't contradict scientific consensus\n   - Important nuances aren't oversimplified to the point of error\n   - The complexity level matches the target audience\n\n7. **Tailor to Audience Level**:\n   - **Beginner**: Use basic analogies, avoid numbers/measurements\n   - **Intermediate**: Can include some technical terms with explanations\n   - **Advanced**: Can reference related concepts and applications\n\n**Output Format**:\nProvide your explanation in <simple_explanation> tags, with these sections:\n1. **Simple Analogy**: One sentence connecting to everyday experience\n2. **Basic Explanation**: 2-3 paragraphs explaining the concept\n3. **Real-World Example**: One concrete application or instance\n4. **Why It Matters**: Brief statement of significance\n\nDo not include technical jargon without explanation. If the concept cannot be accurately simplified to the target audience level, clearly state this limitation.\n\nExample structure:\n<simple_explanation>\n<analogy>DNA is like a recipe book that contains all the instructions for building and running a human body.</analogy>\n<explanation>[Basic explanation paragraphs]</explanation>\n<example>[Real-world application]</example>\n<significance>[Why this matters]</significance>\n</simple_explanation>\n\nBegin your explanation now.",
  "thinking": "I need to explain quantum entanglement to curious high-school students who have taken basic physics but no quantum mechanics. Let me think about the core components first:\n\n1. Two particles that are \"entangled\" - they're connected in a special way\n2. This connection means one particle instantly affects the other\n3. This happens regardless of distance - even if particles are far apart\n4. It's a quantum phenomenon, so it happens at the microscopic level\n5. The particles' states are linked - when you measure one, you instantly know something about the other\n\nNow for analogies - I need something that shows:\n- Instant connection between two things\n- Distance independence\n- Linked states\n\nGood analogies might be:\n- Twin books that always open to the same page\n- Magic coins that always show the same face\n- Two dancers who mirror each other's movements perfectly\n\nI think the magic coins or twin books would work well for high-school students.\n\nFor the basic explanation, I need to:\n- Start simple\n- Build complexity gradually\n- Avoid jargon\n- Use active voice\n- Keep sentences under 20 words\n\nReal-world application - this is tricky because quantum entanglement applications are mostly in research and emerging tech, but I can mention:\n- Quantum computing\n- Quantum cryptography\n- Quantum sensors\n\nWhy it matters - it shows that reality is stranger than we thought, and it's leading to new technologies\n\nLet me structure this properly:\n\nSimple Analogy: Something about connected objects\nBasic Explanation: 2-3 paragraphs building from simple to complex\nReal-World Example: A concrete application\nWhy It Matters: Brief significance statement\n\nI need to be careful not to oversimplify to the point of error. The key nuance is that this is a real quantum phenomenon, not just a theoretical curiosity, and it really does happen instantaneously (though we can't use this to send information faster than light).",
  "output": "<simple_explanation>\n<analogy>Imagine two magic coins that always show the same side - if one lands heads, the other instantly lands heads too, even if one coin is in your pocket and the other is on the moon.</analogy>\n\n<explanation>Quantum entanglement happens when two tiny particles become mysteriously connected. This connection means that measuring one particle instantly tells you something about the other, no matter how far apart they are. The particles don't actually send signals to each other - they just stay connected in a way that defies our everyday experience.\n\nWhen scientists create entangled particles, they become a special pair. Think of them like perfectly matched dancers who always move in harmony. If you watch one dancer and see them spin left, you instantly know the other dancer is spinning right. This happens even if the dancers are in different cities. The connection works immediately, faster than light could travel between them.\n\nThis isn't just a weird science fiction idea - it actually happens in nature. Scientists regularly create entangled particles in laboratories using lasers and special crystals. The particles follow quantum rules that are different from the physics we see in our daily world.</explanation>\n\n<example>Scientists are using quantum entanglement to create ultra-secure communication systems. In quantum cryptography, entangled particles can detect if anyone has intercepted a message. If an eavesdropper tries to read the message, they break the entanglement and the security system detects the interference immediately.</example>\n\n<significance>Quantum entanglement shows us that reality operates in ways more strange and wonderful than we ever imagined, and it's opening doors to revolutionary technologies like quantum computers and unbreakable security systems.</significance>\n</simple_explanation>"
