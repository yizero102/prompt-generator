  "thinking": "I need to carefully analyze this resume against each rubric criterion. Let me start by understanding what information I have in the resume:\n\nJane Doe is a Product Manager with 6 years of experience leading SaaS platform initiatives.\n\nExperience:\n- Senior Product Manager at Nimbus SaaS (2021-Present): Led cross-functional squad shipping analytics dashboard that increased retention by 12%. Established discovery rituals and OKR cadence.\n- Product Manager at CloudBright (2018-2021): Launched onboarding funnel redesign that lifted activation by 18%. Partnered with sales to define enterprise roadmap.\n\nEducation: B.S. Information Systems, Georgia Tech\n\nSkills: Journey mapping, stakeholder facilitation, SQL, Tableau, Agile coaching.\n\nAwards: 2020 Product-Led Growth Award\n\nNow let me analyze each rubric criterion:\n\n1. Problem Discovery (1-5): Ability to uncover user pain points and synthesize insights.\n- The resume mentions \"Established discovery rituals\" but doesn't show direct evidence of uncovering user pain points\n- No specific mentions of user research, user interviews, or pain point identification\n- The changes made (analytics dashboard, onboarding funnel redesign) suggest problems were solved but the discovery process isn't detailed\n- Score likely in the 2-3 range\n\n2. Execution & Delivery (1-5): Track record of shipping impactful features, working cross-functional.\n- Clear evidence of delivery: \"Led cross-functional squad shipping analytics dashboard\"\n- Clear impact metrics: \"increased retention by 12%\" and \"lifted activation by 18%\"\n- Shows cross-functional work: \"Led cross-functional squad\" and \"Partnered with sales\"\n- Strong execution track record\n- Score likely in the 4-5 range\n\n3. Strategic Thinking (1-5): Evidence of roadmap ownership, OKR alignment, long-term vision.\n- \"Established discovery rituals and OKR cadence\" shows alignment with OKRs\n- \"Partnered with sales to define enterprise roadmap\" shows roadmap ownership\n- However, lacks evidence of long-term vision or strategic planning beyond these mentions\n\n\n- Score likely in the 3-4 range\n\n4. Communication (1-5): Clarity in stakeholder management, storytelling, and documentation.\n- \"Journey mapping\" and \"stakeholder facilitation\" skills are relevant\n- \"Partnered with sales to define enterprise roadmap\" shows stakeholder management\n- However, limited specific examples of communication achievements\n- Score likely in the 3 range\n\n5. Technical Fluency (1-5): Comfort with data, experimentation, and engineering collaboration.\n- Skills listed: \"SQL, Tableau\" indicate data proficiency\n- \"Agile coaching\" shows technical/process knowledge\n- \"Partnered with sales\" suggests cross-functional collaboration\n- Lack of explicit engineering collaboration details\n- Score likely in the 3-4 range\n\nI'll develop a comprehensive assessment capturing these nuanced insights, highlighting both strengths and areas for potential growth in each criterion.",
  "output": "I'll conduct a thorough analysis of this resume against each rubric criterion before providing my assessment.\n\n**Analysis of each rubric criterion:**\n\n**1. Problem Discovery (1-5):**\nLooking at the resume, I can see mentions of \"discovery rituals\" but these are described more as processes that were established rather than the actual discovery work performed. There's no evidence of user research methods, interviews, or specific pain point identification. The initiatives mentioned (analytics dashboard, onboarding funnel redesign) imply problems were solved, but the discovery methodology isn't detailed.\n\n**2. Execution & Delivery (1-5):**\nThis criterion shows strong evidence. The resume clearly demonstrates \"Led cross-functional squad shipping analytics dashboard\" showing both cross-functional collaboration and successful delivery. The metrics are compelling: \"increased retention by 12%\" and \"lifted activation by 18%\" provide clear impact measurement. The dual company experience spanning 6 years shows sustained delivery.\n\n**3. Strategic Thinking (1-5):**\nThe resume shows evidence of strategic alignment through \"Established... OKR cadence\" and \"Partnered with sales to define enterprise roadmap.\" However, while these show strategic involvement, the description lacks depth about long-term vision, strategic planning processes, or how these initiatives fit into broader company objectives beyond the immediate roadmap definition.\n\n**4. Communication (1-5):**\nSkills listed include \"journey mapping\" and \"stakeholder facilitation\" which are relevant communication competencies. The experience section shows \"Partnered with sales to define enterprise roadmap\" demonstrating stakeholder management. However, specific communication achievements, storytelling examples, or documentation examples are limited in the provided content.\n\n**5. Technical Fluency (1-5):**\nThe resume shows technical competency through skills like \"SQL\" and \"Tableau\" indicating data analysis capabilities, and \"Agile coaching\" showing process/technical collaboration knowledge. The cross-functional squad leadership suggests engineering collaboration, though specific technical collaboration examples aren't detailed.\n\n---\n\n## **Comprehensive Assessment**\n\n### **Evidence Supporting Each Criterion:**\n\n**Problem Discovery:**\n- \"Established discovery rituals\" (lacks depth on methodology)\n- No specific user research or pain point identification examples\n\n**Execution & Delivery:**\n"
