  "thinking": "Alright, I'm looking at this resume and the rubric for a Product Manager role. First, I need to understand what each criterion in the rubric is asking. The rubric has five key areas: Problem Discovery, Execution & Delivery, Strategic Thinking, Communication, and Technical Fluency. Each is scored from 1 to 5. \n\nFor Problem Discovery, I need to see if the candidate shows an ability to uncover user pain points. The resume mentions Jane Doe led an analytics dashboard that increased retention by 12% and redesigned an onboarding funnel that lifted activation by 18%. These indicate she identified problems in user experience but doesn't explicitly talk about the discovery process. She might have done research, but it's not detailed here. I should note that the evidence is indirect.\n\nNext, Execution & Delivery. She's been in senior roles, leading cross-functional teams and shipping features. The cross-functional squad and partnership with sales suggest good collaboration. The achievements in retention and activation show tangible impact, so that points to strong execution. I'll need to quote those parts and assess her delivery skills based on those outcomes.\n\nStrategic Thinking involves owning roadmaps and aligning with OKRs. At Nimbus SaaS, she established OKR cadence, which is a strategic process. Partnering with sales at CloudBright to define the enterprise roadmap shows strategic alignment. However, there's no mention of long-term vision beyond these specific initiatives. I should look for any mention of future-oriented strategies, but the resume doesn't go into that. The evidence is there, but maybe not as robust.\n\nCommunication covers stakeholder management and storytelling. She's facilitated stakeholder rituals and partnered with sales, which implies communication. The journey mapping skill also suggests she communicates user needs clearly. But there's no specific mention of documentation or presentation skills. I should check if her achievements are presented clearly, which they are in the resume, so she might be good at communicating impact.\n\nTechnical Fluency is about comfort with data, experimentation, and engineering. She has SQL and Tableau skills, which are technical tools. Using data to measure retention and activation shows she works with metrics. Partnering with engineers is implied in cross-functional squads, but the resume doesn't detail engineering collaboration beyond that. She might be technically proficient, but the evidence is limited to tools, not deep technical involvement.\n\nPutting it all together, Jane Doe seems strong in Execution & Delivery and Strategic Thinking, with good Communication and Technical Fluency indicators. Problem Discovery is less clear. Each criterion needs specific evidence quotes. \n\nFor the overall score, I need to rate each from 1 to 5. Problem Discovery: 3 (indirect evidence). Execution & Delivery: 4 (strong impact). Strategic Thinking: 3 (some evidence, lacking long-term vision). Communication: 3 (good stakeholder work, but limited examples). Technical Fluency: 3 (tools listed, but no deep collaboration mentioned). \n\nFeedback should focus on areas needing more depth. For Problem Discovery, suggest adding specific research methods. For Communication, mention training documentation. For Technical Fluency, discuss engineering partnerships. Also, highlight strengths like measurable achievements and cross-functional leadership.",
  "output": "### Internal Monologue Analysis of Resume Against Rubric\n\nI will methodically analyze Jane Doe's resume against each criterion in the Product Manager Evaluation Rubric, focusing on evidence within the provided text:\n\n1.  **Problem Discovery (1-5):** The resume shows quantifiable impacts (12% retention increase, 18% activation lift) but lacks explicit details on *how* she uncovered the underlying user pain points *leading to* these initiatives (e.g., user interviews, usability studies). Her skills mention \"Journey mapping,\" which indicates an awareness of the process. Evidence for deep synthesis of insights is limited.\n2.  **Execution & Delivery (1-5):** Strong evidence exists. She successfully \"Led cross-functional squad\" and \"Partnered with sales,\" demonstrating cross-functional collaboration. The shipping of an \"analytics dashboard\" and \"onboarding funnel redesign\" are concrete feature deliveries. Quantifiable outcomes (12% retention, 18% activation) demonstrate impact. Her current \"Senior\" role and achievement-based bullet points indicate a strong delivery track record.\n3.  **Strategic Thinking (1-5):** The resume contains good evidence. She \"Established discovery rituals and OKR cadence\" (Nimbus SaaS) which shows an understanding of and implementation of strategic frameworks. At CloudBright, she \"Partnered with sales to define enterprise roadmap,\" demonstrating involvement in strategic roadmap ownership and alignment. However, evidence of independently defining and articulating a *long-term product vision* is absent.\n4.  **Communication (1-5):** Evidence is present but somewhat indirect. \"Stakeholder facilitation\" and \"Partnered with sales\" suggest stakeholder management skills. \"Journey mapping\" implies ability to synthesize and communicate complex user journeys. The clear, action-oriented writing in the resume itself demonstrates communication competence. However, specific examples of storytelling or formal documentation achievements are lacking.\n5.  **Technical Fluency (1-5):** Moderate evidence. The explicit skills listed (\""
