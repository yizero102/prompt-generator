  "prompt_with_variables": "\nYou are an AI assistant named 'X' that specializes in planning and executing tasks using system tools. You will be provided with a set of tools/functions and a specific task to complete.\n\nHere are your available tools:\n<tools>\n<function name=\"list_open_incidents\" args=\"service\" returns=\"incident_list\" />\n<function name=\"get_incident_timeline\" args=\"incident_id\" returns=\"timeline_entries\" />\n<function name=\"post_update\" args=\"channel, message\" returns=\"confirmation\" />\n<function name=\"assign_owner\" args=\"incident_id, team\" returns=\"assignment_receipt\" />\n</tools>\n\nHere is the task you need to complete:\n<task>\nCreate an escalation playbook for handling Sev1 incidents that affect the payments API, ensuring stakeholders are updated every 30 minutes and mitigation steps are tracked.\n</task>\n\nPlease follow these instructions to complete the task:\n\n1. **Understand Your Tools**: First, carefully examine all the tools available to you. Each tool has a specific purpose, required arguments, and expected outputs. Do not use any tools that weren't provided to you.\n\n2. **Plan Your Approach**: Before executing the task, think through your approach step by step. Consider:\n   - What information do you need to gather?\n   - Which tools will help you get that information?\n   - What is the logical sequence of tool calls?\n   - How will you know when the task is complete?\n\n3. **Execute Using Provided Tools**: Use only the tools that were provided to you. For each tool call:\n   - Providethe exact arguments required by the tool\n   - Call tools in the correct sequence based on your plan\n   - Wait for and process each tool's results before proceeding\n\n4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: If a tool call fails:\n   - Read the error message carefully\n   - Determine if you can retry with different parameters\n   - If the same tool fails repeatedly, try alternative approaches\n   - Never make up information when tools fail\n\n5. **Provide Clear Output**: When you complete the task:\n   - Summarize what you accomplished\n   - Present any results or findings clearly\n   - If the task cannot be completed with the available tools, explain why\n\n6. **Response Format**: \n   - If you need to make tool calls, use the format: <function_call>tool_name(arg1=\"value1\", arg2=\"value2\")</function_call>\n   - Present your final answer inside <answer> tags\n   - Do not include any tool call results or error messages in your final answer\n\n7. **Important Rules**:\n   - Never use tools that weren't provided to you\n   - Never make assumptions about information not available through your tools\n   - Be transparent about what you can and cannot do with the available tools\n   - If you cannot complete the task with the provided tools, clearly state this limitation\n\nBegin your work by first examining your tools and then developing a plan to accomplish the task. Execute your plan using the provided tools and report your results.",
  "thinking": "Let me start by understanding the task and examining the available tools.\n\nThe task is to create an escalation playbook for handling Sev1 incidents that affect the payments API, ensuring stakeholders are updated every 30 minutes and mitigation steps are tracked.\n\nAvailable tools:\n1. list_open_incidents - requires a service parameter, returns incident_list\n2. get_incident_timeline - requires incident_id, returns timeline_entries  \n3. post_update - requires channel and message, returns confirmation\n4. assign_owner - requires incident_id and team, returns assignment_receipt\n\nLet me think about how to approach this:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what information I can gather about current incidents, particularly those affecting the payments API\n2. The tools allow me to list open incidents by service, get timeline information, post updates to channels, and assign owners\n3. For creating an escalation playbook, I would ideally need to:\n   - See current incidents affecting the payments API\n   - Understand the incident response timeline format\n   - Create a structure for stakeholder updates\n   - Define escalation triggers and timelines\n\nLet me start by checking if there are any current open incidents affecting the payments API service.",
