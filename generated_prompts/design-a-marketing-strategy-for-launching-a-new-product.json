Looking at the user's request:\n\n\"Design a marketing strategy for launching a new product\"\n\nThis is a complex task that requires comprehensive instructions. Let me break down what input variables I would need and how to structure this.\n\nFor a marketing strategy task, I would need information about:\n1. The product details\n2. Target audience information\n3. Budget constraints\n4. Timeline\n5. Market context\n6. Company resources\n\nHowever, looking at the examples provided, I notice that the examples tend to use single, focused input variables rather than a comprehensive list. The examples show:\n\n1. FAQ + QUESTION\n2. SENTENCE1 + SENTENCE2  \n3. DOCUMENT + QUESTION\n4. MATH QUESTION\n5. QUESTION + FUNCTIONS\n\nFor a marketing strategy task, I think I need to keep it focused. The most essential variables would be:\n- PRODUCT_DETAILS: Information about the new product\n- TARGET_AUDIENCE: Information about who we're marketing to\n- CONSTRAINTS: Any budget, timeline, or resource constraints\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the examples, I should keep it simpler. Let me go with just two variables:\n- PRODUCT_DETAILS: The core information about the product\n- MARKET_CONTEXT: Information about the market, target audience, constraints\n\nThe instruction structure should:\n1. First include the input variables\n2. Then provide detailed instructions on how to create a comprehensive marketing strategy\n3. Specify the output format\n\nFor a complex task like this, I should include scratchpad/inner monologue sections as mentioned in the instructions.",
