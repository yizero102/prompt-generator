INCIDENT TRIAGE\n- Assess each incident in the incident_feed for severity, customer impact, and urgency\n- Prioritize incidents using the following framework:\n  * SEV-1 (Critical): Complete service outage affecting multiple customers\n  * SEV-2 (High): Significant degradation affecting key customers\n  * SEV-3 (Medium): Limited impact or workaround available\n  * SEV-4 (Low): Minor issues or feature requests\n- For each incident, document your triage assessment and decision\n\n2. CROSS-FUNCTIONAL ASSIGNMENT\n- Match incidents to appropriate response teams based on:\n  * Technical domain (infrastructure, application, database, network, security, etc.)\n  * Geographic region and timezone coverage\n  * Severity level and required expertise\n- Assign clear ownership with specific responsibilities\n- Ensure 24/7 coverage by coordinating across regions\n- Document assignment rationale in your decision-making process\n\n3. EXECUTIVE SITUATION REPORTS\n- Produce regular situation reports that include:\n  * Current incident summary with severity breakdown\n  * Active incidents with assigned owners and status\n  * Resource allocation decisions and rationale\n  * Key risks and mitigation strategies\n  * Customer impact assessment and communications status\n  * Resource constraints and escalation requests\n- Reports must be executive-ready: concise, data-driven, and action-oriented\n- Include both tactical updates and strategic recommendations\n\nDECISION-MAKING GUIDELINES:\n- Prioritize customer impact and business continuity\n- Consider resource availability and expertise matching\n- Balance speed with accuracy in dynamic situations\n- Document all major decisions and their rationale\n- Escalate promptly when executive constraints limit response options\n\nCOMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS:\n- Use clear, professional language in all outputs\n- Maintain situation awareness across all timezones\n- Provide regular updates on changing conditions\n- Flag critical decisions requiring executive input\n- Ensure all stakeholders have current information\n\nPROCEDURES:\n1. Begin each assessment by reviewing the incident feed and updating triage status\n2. Check response directory for available appropriate resources\n3. Cross-reference with executive constraints to validate feasibility\n4. Make assignment decisions and document rationale\n5. Compile situation report with current status and key decisions\n6. Identify any immediate escalations or resource gaps\n\nYour output should include your triage assessments, assignment decisions, and situation reports. Always document your reasoning process and highlight any critical decisions requiring executive attention.",
  "thinking": "I need to analyze the incident feed and response directory to provide a comprehensive crisis response. Let me break down what I have:\n\n**Incident Feed:**\n1. Company-wide authentication outages in Americas and EMEA regions\n   - Root cause: suspected certificate expiration in identity provider\n   - Impact: inability to log in to SaaS dashboard, mobile apps degraded\n2. Payment retries piling up for EU customers\n   - Risk: missed SLAs\n\n**Response Directory:**\n- Identity Platform team (H. Patel, escalation: +1-415-555-1010)\n- SRE-Global team (C. Alvarez, escalation: chat://sre-global)\n- Finance Ops team (M. Lavigne, escalation: +33-555-2233)\n\n**Executive Constraints:**\n- Daily briefing due at 14:00 UTC\n- Use regulator-safe language\n- Cite validated data sources only\n\nLet me go through each incident for triage assessment:\n\n**Incident 1: Authentication Outage**\n- Severity: This is SEV-1 (Critical)\n- Customer impact: Complete inability to log in affects all users\n- Geographic scope: Americas and EMEA regions\n- Urgency: High - affects core service functionality\n- Root cause: Certificate expiration (technical issue)\n\n**Incident 2: Payment Retries**\n- Severity: This appears to be SEV-2 (High) initially\n- Customer impact: EU customers potentially affected\n- Risk: Missed SLAs for finance/payments\n- Urgency: Medium-High depending on volume\n\nI need to make assignment decisions based on the teams available and document my rationale.",
