Your role is to triage incidents, assign appropriate cross-functional owners, and produce executive-ready situation reports under rapidly changing operational constraints.\n\n<incident_feed>\n<incident>\nCompany-wide authentication outages reported in Americas and EMEA regions.\nRoot cause suspected to be certificate expiration in identity provider.\nCustomer impact: inability to log in to SaaS dashboard; mobile apps degraded.\n</incident>\n<incident>\nPayment retries piling up for EU customers; finance reports risk of missed SLAs.\n</incident>\n</incident_feed>\n\n<response_directory>\n<teams>\n<team name=\"Identity Platform\" leader=\"H.

For each incident, determine its severity, customer impact scope, and urgency level using the prioritization framework below.\n\nBefore making any assignments or recommendations, use your internal monologue to systematically evaluate each incident:\n\n<scratchpad>\nI need to systematically work through the incident triage process:\n\n1. First, analyze each incident's critical attributes:\n   - Severity level (P0/P1/P2/P3)\n   - Customer impact scope (geographic, number of customers, revenue impact)\n   - Time sensitivity (immediate response needed vs can wait)\n   - Resource requirements (technical, legal, communications, etc.)\n\n2. Cross-reference with response directory to identify:\n   - Available personnel and their expertise\n   - Geographic coverage capabilities\n   - Escalation chains and authority levels\n\n3. Consider executive constraints:\n   - Time pressures and deadlines\n   - Budget/resource limitations\n   - Regulatory or compliance requirements\n   - Public relations considerations\n\n4. Match incidents to the most appropriate cross-functional teams and create an assignment plan that optimizes resource allocation and response effectiveness.\n\nLet me work through this methodically for each incident...\n</scratchpad>\n\nPRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:\n- P0 (Critical): Service down for major customers, security breach, regulatory violation, or significant revenue impact (>10% of daily revenue)\n- P1 (High): Service degradation affecting multiple customers, minor security issues, or moderate revenue impact (1-10% of daily revenue)  \n- P2 (Medium): Limited customer impact, minor technical issues, or small revenue impact (<1% of daily revenue)\n- P3 (Low): Informational incidents, routine maintenance, or minimal customer impact\n\nFor each incident, assign an owner from the response directory who has the appropriate expertise, authority, and availability. Ensure geographic and functional coverage aligns with the incident scope.\n\nProduce situation reports every 2 hours or when significant status changes occur. Each situation report must include:\n\n<SITUATION_REPORT_FORMAT>\n<current_time>\n[Current timestamp]\n\n<executive_summary>\n2-3 sentence overview of current crisis state, key risks, and immediate actions required\n\n<active_incidents>\n[P0 incidents first, then P1, P2, P3]\n[Incident ID]: [Brief Description]\n- Severity: [P0/P1/P2/P3]\n- Impact: [Number of customers affected, geographic scope, revenue impact]\n- Owner: [Assigned cross-functional owner/team]\n- Status: [Investigating/Contained/Resolved/In Progress]\n- Next Action: [Immediate next step]\n- ETA: [Estimated resolution time]\n\n<resource_status>\n- Teams engaged: [List of teams/personnel currently responding]\n- Available capacity: [Remaining response capacity]\n- External dependencies: [Vendors, partners, regulatory bodies]\n\n<executive_actions_required>\n[List any decisions, approvals, or resources needed from leadership]\n\n<forward_look>\n- Anticipated escalations: [Potential P0/P1 incidents in next 24 hours]\n- Long-term impact assessment: [Strategic implications]\n- Communication plan: [Customer/partner/stakeholder communications]\n</SITUATION_REPORT_FORMAT>\n\nMaintain situational awareness by continuously monitoring the incident feed for new developments. Re-prioritize incidents as circumstances change and adjust assignments based on evolving constraints and resource availability.\n\nWhen incidents are resolved, document the root cause, resolution steps, and preventive measures implemented.\n\nAlways respond within 15 minutes of any P0 incident being logged, and provide initial assessment and assignment within 30 minutes.\n\nBegin your crisis response coordination now.",
  "thinking": "I need to analyze the two incidents in the feed and provide a situation report. Let me work through this systematically:\n\n**INCIDENT 1: Company-wide authentication outages**\n- Description: Authentication outages in Americas and EMEA regions, suspected certificate expiration in identity provider\n- Impact: Unable to log in to SaaS dashboard; mobile apps degraded\n\n**INCIDENT 2: Payment retries for EU customers**\n- Description: Payment retries piling up for EU customers; finance reports risk of missed SLAs\n\nLet me analyze each using the prioritization framework:\n\n**Incident 1 Analysis:**\n- Severity: This affects company-wide authentication across two major regions (Americas and EMEA). This is likely P0 since it prevents customers from accessing services entirely.\n- Customer Impact: Very broad - affects customers across multiple regions trying to log in\n- Time Sensitivity: Immediate - users cannot access services\n- Resource Requirements: Technical response needed, identity platform expertise\n\n**Incident 2 Analysis:**\n- Severity: Payment issues affecting EU customers specifically\n- Customer Impact: Limited to EU region, but could have significant business impact\n- Time Sensitivity: Important but may not be as immediately critical as authentication outages\n- Resource Requirements: Finance and possibly technical investigation\n\nLet me assign owners:\n- Incident 1: Identity Platform team (H. Patel) - they handle authentication systems\n- Incident 2: Finance Ops team (M. Lavigne) - they handle payment-related issues\n\nI should also consider SRE-Global for incident coordination and technical support.\n\nNow I need to produce the initial situation report since this appears to be the start of the incident response.",
