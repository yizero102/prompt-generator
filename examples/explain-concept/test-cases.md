## Test Metrics

For each test case, evaluate:
1. **Audience Appropriateness**: Is language suitable for stated audience?
2. **Clarity**: Would the target audience understand this?
3. **Accuracy**: Is the science correct?
4. **Engagement**: Is it interesting and relatable?
5. **Structure**: Are all required sections included?
6. **Analogies**: Are analogies helpful and accurate?

## Passing Criteria
- 6/6 test cases must be scientifically accurate
- 6/6 must use audience-appropriate language
- 5/6 must include helpful analogies
- All must follow the specified output format
- No misleading oversimplifications
