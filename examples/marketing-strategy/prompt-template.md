## Example Usage

**Input:**
- PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION: "EcoBottle - A smart water bottle that tracks hydration, reminds you to drink water, syncs with fitness apps, and is made from 100% recycled materials. Retail price: $49.99"
- TARGET_MARKET: "Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z (ages 22-35), active lifestyle, environmental awareness, tech-savvy"
- BUDGET: "$50,000"
- TIMELINE: "3-month launch campaign, product available in 6 weeks"

**Expected Output:**
```
<situation_analysis>
Product Positioning: EcoBottle combines three key value propositions: health tracking (hydration monitoring), sustainability (recycled materials), and convenience (app integration). This positions it at the intersection of wellness tech and eco-friendly lifestyle products.

Target Audience: Ages 22-35, health-conscious, tech-savvy, environmentally aware. This demographic is active on Instagram and TikTok, values authenticity, and is willing to pay premium for sustainable products. They use fitness apps regularly and are influenced by wellness influencers.

Competition: Traditional smart water bottles (HidrateSpark, Thermos Smart Lid) focus on tech but not sustainability. Eco-friendly bottles (Hydro Flask, Klean Kanteen) lack smart features. EcoBottle's combination is unique.

Opportunities: Growing wellness and sustainability trends, fitness app integration market, gift-giving season approaching
Challenges: $49.99 is premium pricing, need to justify value over competitors
